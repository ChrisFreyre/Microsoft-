# Microsoft Movie Analysis

**Authors**: Chris Freyre

## Overview

The business problem is that Microsoft want to create a new movie studio. They need recommendations, so they can choose the right type of films. 

For this project I have decided to use the following data sets: Imdb.title.basics, Imdb.title.ratings, bom.movie_gross. In these data sets, each one has a common data point so I merged them together to provide a more clean and complete data set. Through analysis of this data, I've created 3 business recommendations in relation to movie studios: The top 5 movie studios. The movie genres with the highest domestic gross and Movie genres with the highest ratings. 


## Business Problem

Microsoft are unaware of what type of move to create in their new movie studio. For this we need to ask ourselves the best way to apporoach this project, would be with 3 different points of view, which are 1) top movies studios, 2) top genres and 3) top ratings. 

With question one we will be pointed in the right direction following a succesful company proven to perform not only well but also to have proven facts with domestic gross total over the other movie studios. Question two will join our answer from question one because not only movie studios are performing well, they will have a pattern of genres in their movie top sellers. Finally question three will join in with the same pattern but from the viewers perspective voting for the type of movies that they love that would be correlated with the top movies in the market.

I will create solutions from the data set provided, having 3 different points of view. Business perspective from the data of other movie studios performance with their own domestic gross, then match that result to the top genre movies from the other data sets and combine them with the perspective of the viewers through the top rated movies. 


Microsoft has this data but all separated or messy data, so it makes it hard to read, that's why I not only joined 3 datasets together, before merging them I cleaned them all, for a better performance now and for the future.


## Data

Describe the data being used for this project.
We got a dataset with domestic gross that would soulve our question number one, then we move into movie titles because has all the data from the movies genres, names, etc that would complemente our answer about top genres and combine with last dataset f ratings top genres, top movies, top movie studios are all link

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:

## Conclusions

Provide your conclusions about the work you've done, including any limitations or next steps.

***
Questions to consider:
* What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
* What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
* What else could you do in the future to improve this project?
